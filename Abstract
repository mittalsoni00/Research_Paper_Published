**ABSTRACT:-** 
Privacy is a necessity for security, espe
cially in information communication technology in
terfaces. This has been so due to the rising use of
 technology, which has made it difficult to guarantee
 data authenticity and credibility when passing mes
sages. As a result, secure communication is often in
 a state of potential jeopardy. This has been a com
plex problem to solve, and steganography, which in
volves hiding the identification information in cover
 media, has been utilized to solve it. The analysis and
 comparison of the currently existing steganographic
 techniques presented in this paper consider problems
 such as robustness, visibility, security, integrity, and
 data storage. In order to overcome these challenges,
 the present research work is aimed to develop a new
 steganographic model that is made more robust, can
 carry more amount of payload, and is more secure
 from detection. Our design applied and enhanced the
 use of cryptographic procedures and randomized salts
 to make the data more hidden and secure from any
 third party. In addition, we use ECC blocks with suit
able padding to protect data during transmission and
 exclude data loss. The proposed model offers a loss
less solution with high security and, in the context
 of this work, is immune to the challenges of network
 transmission and steganalysis.
