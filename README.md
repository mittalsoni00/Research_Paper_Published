Randomized Salt LSB: A Novel Approach to Steganography  with Improved Concealment and Robustness

This research focuses on improving **steganographic techniques** for secure communication by addressing key challenges like **robustness, security, visibility, integrity, and data storage**. Our proposed model enhances **cryptographic procedures** with **randomized salts** and utilizes **LSB technique** to prevent data loss. The approach ensures **high security, lossless transmission, and resistance to steganalysis**, making it more effective against detection threats.
